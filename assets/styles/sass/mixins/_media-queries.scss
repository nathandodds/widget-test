MIXIN = MEDIA QUERIES 
---------------------

This mixin can be used for when we are building a responsive website from mobile first.
It is using the basic concept that was originally posted by Chris Coyier from CSS Tricks and adapted 
slightly to fit around our desired templates.

// Mixin content
@mixin bp($point) {

	// If our media queries are set to true (as they are by default) 
	// then we want to add our media query breakpoints
	@if ($MQs) == true {
		/*
		 * Examples of other breakpoints we could add:
		 *
		 * $bp-kindle: "(min-width: 569px)";
		 * $bp-ipadport: "(min-width: 768px)";
		 * $bp-ipadland: "(min-width: 1024px)";
		 * $bp-desktop: "(min-width: 1025px)";

		// Our desktop styles start from this size as the max mobile width is 568px (iphone 5 landscape)
		$bp-mobile: "(max-width: 568px)"; 
		$bp-desktop: "(min-width: 569px)"; 

		@if $point == mobile {
			@media #{$bp-mobile} { @content; }
		}

		@if $point == desktop {
			@media #{$bp-desktop} { @content; }
		}
	}

	// If we are on an older browser such as ie8 or lower that doesn't support media queries we want
	// to just display all our styling within our class without our breakpoints and the hierarchy will
	// adopt our other styles so our desktop version will look the same
	@else if ($MQs) == false {
		@content;
	}
